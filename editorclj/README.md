# Hoplon / Castra / Javelin quick reference

* Cells

```clojure
(defc val "initial-value")
(reset! val "new-value")
```

* Formula cells, interpolation, and template loops over cells containing seqs:

```clojure
(defc= double-val (str val ", " val)) ; Automatically recalculated

(h1 "Hello, ~{double-val}")

(loop-tpl :bindings [var1 val1 var2 val2]
  (div :id var1 (text var2)))
```

* Inside regular code, cells are like refs

```clojure
(println @double-val)
```

* Responding to DOM events

```clojure
(a :click #(reset! val double-val))
```

* Client-server communication

  * On the server

```clojure
(def state (atom {session-state}))

(defrpc rpc-event-fn [arg1 arg2 ... argn]
  (do-something-in-response-to-the-event)
  (swap! state calculate-new-state))
```

  * Client-side

```clojure
; Session state, plus RPC state
(defc state {})
(defc error nil)
(defc= error-message (when error (.-message error)))
(defc loading [])
(def clear-error! #(reset! error nil))

; Define RPC apis inside client
(def rpc-event-fn (mkremote 'package/rpc-event-fn state error loading))  ; Notice, parameters aren't declared here

; Call RPC on server from client
(defn dom-event-handler [_]
  (rpc-event-fn arg1 arg2 argn))  ; Parameters here must match those declared on the server
```

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]

## Usage
### Development
1. Start the `dev` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot dev
    ```
    This will give you a  Hoplon development setup with:
    - auto compilation on file changes
    - audible warning for compilation success or failures
    - auto reload the html page on changes
    - Clojurescript REPL

2. Go to [http://localhost:8000][3] in your browser. You should see "Hello,
Hoplon and Castra!" with random numbers that are generated on the server and
transmited to the client. But you should change that to what you want.

3. If you edit and save a file, the task will recompile the code and reload the
   browser to show the updated version.

.### Production
1. Run the `prod` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot prod
    ```
2. The compiled files will be on the `target/` directory. This will use
   advanced compilation and prerender the html.

### Deployment

1. Create an application in the Heroku dashboard
1. Build a WAR file with `boot make-war`
